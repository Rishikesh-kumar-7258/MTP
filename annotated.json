purpose of this study was to describe the ultrasonographic (US) and computed tomographic (CT) appearance of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) in cats; to compare renal volume in cats with ADPKD (n = 5; mean age 59 +\/- 10 months)) and normal cats (n = 5; mean age 66 +\/- 10 months) using 2 imaging modalities, US and CT; and to calculate cyst volume using CT. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was determined by 2 methods: 99mTc-diethylene-triaminepentaacetic acid (99mTc-DPTA) scintigraphic uptake and 99-Tc-DTPA plasma clearance."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2025-08-28T11:02:08.903594Z","updated_at":"2025-08-31T10:00:05.058318Z","inner_id":86,"total_annotations":0,"cancelled_annotations":1,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":4,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":88,"annotations":[{"id":437,"completed_by":1,"result":[],"was_cancelled":true,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2025-08-31T10:00:07.395036Z","updated_at":"2025-08-31T10:00:07.395059Z","draft_created_at":null,"lead_time":2.113,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"9374a8b6-492b-4998-b908-764ae638a20e","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"bulk_created":false,"task":88,"project":4,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"d65f4761-unlabelled_sentences.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"text":"Highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART) consisting of efavirenz, 3TC, and d4T was started."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2025-08-28T11:02:08.903748Z","updated_at":"2025-08-31T10:00:07.414209Z","inner_id":88,"total_annotations":0,"cancelled_annotations":1,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":4,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]}]
